Shell Script Building Blocks
============================

This is ever-evolving repository to contains tips, tricks, code snippets
and other building blocks for shell scripts...

shbb.org
--------

shbb.org__ contains many useful code blocks to be used as building parts
of shell scripts.

__ shbb.org

snippets.md__ is somewhat like shbb.org, but without explanations.

__ snippets.md

interactive shell blocks
------------------------

code that can be used in configuration files of interactive__ shells

(e.g. bash & zsh eternal histories)

__ interactive.rst


templates
---------

templates__ directory contains various shell constructs to be used around
and inside code files of many languages.

__ templates


sh-portabilitytest.sh
---------------------

this script__ is valuable hac^H^H^H^H tool to determine which (builtin!)
shell constructs work with which shell.

__ portabilitytest/sh-portabilitytest.sh

now some results available
in portabilitytest-*.org (linux__, freebsd7.1__, solaris10__).
