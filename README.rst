This is ever-evolving repository to contains tips, tricks, code snippets
and other building blocks for shell scripts..

shbb.org

shbb.org__ contains the most generic code blocks that this repository will

sh-portabilitytest.sh
---------------------

This script__ is valuable tool to determine which (builtin!) shell
